# Harmonia Network

## General Information
Harmonia Network tries to provide a sustainable funding mechanism for underfunded projects in the crypto space by leveraging DeFi and staking mechanisms. 

This platform enables users to stake funds in ETH, converting them to hETH (with a 1:1 value to ETH), to generate yield. Projects or communities can set the minimum donation percentage they require, while users have the flexibility to choose the amount of ETH to stake and the percentage of yield they wish to donate. This approach reduces the psychological barrier to support, as users contribute indirectly through staking yields without an explicit financial loss.

Harmonia Network can incorporate a Proof of Contribution through Hypercerts, allowing supporters to earn tokens or NFTs based on their contributions. These incentives strengthen the connection between users and projects while promoting ongoing support.

## Contract structure
Harmonia Network (MVP) structure includes the following core contracts

- Harmonia Interface: Managing each staker's accounting
- RouterManager: Managing staking protocol and upgrade the underlying router
- Router: Handle actual staking mechanism
